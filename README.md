# ML-Classifiers-in-Python
Build raw KNN and Naive Bayes classifers based on given Dataset

********* This folder contains all the files for running both Naive Bayes and KNN Algorithm **********



*** STEPS TO FOLLOW ****

		1. Download KNN.py , NaiveBayes.py and CrossValidation.py in the folder where you expect the code to run
		2. Run FinalKNN.ipynb and FinalNB.ipynb on Jupyter notebook/lab 
		3. These two final files will use functions from KNN.py,NaiveBayes.py and CrossValidation.py 
		4. For referance FinalKNN_ivan.ipynb and FinalNB_ivan.ipynb can be used as raw files  

*** THANK YOU ****
